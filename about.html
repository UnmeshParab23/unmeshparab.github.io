        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Unmesh Parab, and I am currently pursuing my First Year Bachelor of
            Management Studies (BMS) degree at Aditya Institute Of Management Studies & Research.
            I consider myself a thoughtful, kind, and welcoming individual who values meaningful
            conversations and believes in listening deeply to others.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have a calm and introspective nature and often prefer peaceful environments such as
            staying at home or spending quiet time by the beach. At the same time, I am adaptable
            and believe that my personality lies somewhere between introversion and extroversion,
            making me an ambivert.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy drawing sketches, gaming, and watching Formula 1, along with practicing racing
            on simulators. I am passionate about music and enjoy listening to it on high-quality
            speakers. I am also a car and bike enthusiast and take pride in making a good cup of coffee.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe in peace, personal growth, and the idea of a utopian world where people feel
            heard, valued, and included.
