    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Unmesh Parab. I am an FYBMS student at Aditya Institute Of
        Management Studies & Research, Borivali(W)
    </p>

    <p>
        My hobbies include drawing sketches, gaming, watching Formula 1 and
        practicing racing on simulators. I am passionate about music and enjoy
        listening to it on quality speakers. I am also a car and bike enthusiast
        and enjoy making good coffee.
    </p>

    <p>
        I consider myself a kind and welcoming person who listens deeply to
        conversations and believes in peace. I prefer calm environments such as
        being at home or sitting quietly on a beach. I believe my personality
        lies between introvert and extrovert, making me an ambivert.
        I believe in peace, personal growth, and the idea of a utopian world where people feel
        heard, valued, and included.
